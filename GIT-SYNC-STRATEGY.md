# Fast LIFe - Git Sync Strategy (Phase C Execution)

> **Purpose:** Mandatory Git checkpoints for all Phase C work
>
> **Rule:** SYNC EVERYTHING after every phase and major milestone
>
> **Date:** October 17, 2025

## 🎯 SYNC PHILOSOPHY

**"Commit Early, Commit Often, Push Always"**

### Why This Matters:
1. **Disaster Recovery:** Work saved remotely if local machine fails
2. **Team Visibility:** Everyone sees progress in real-time
3. **Rollback Safety:** Can revert to any checkpoint if something breaks
4. **Documentation Trail:** Git history tells the story of Phase C
5. **External Collaboration:** Consultants can review progress at checkpoints

---

## 📋 MANDATORY SYNC CHECKPOINTS

### Checkpoint 0: PRE-PHASE C (IMMEDIATE - Before Starting)
**When:** RIGHT NOW (before any Phase C work)
**What:** All documentation, current code state, Phase C plan
**Branch:** `feat/phase-c-prep`
**Commit Message:**
```
docs: Phase C preparation - documentation and expert analysis

- Add AI Expert independent evaluation (7.3/10 baseline)
- Add external developer feedback (iOS Lead + Senior QA)
- Add comprehensive execution plan (3-week roadmap to 9/10)
- Add scoring criteria and tracker audit
- Add code quality standards and LOC policy
- Add Git sync strategy for Phase C checkpoints

📖 Phase C Status: READY TO START
🎯 Target: 9.0/10 minimum across all dimensions
⏱️ Timeline: 3 weeks (Day 1-17)

## 🚨 EMERGENCY CHECKPOINT PROTOCOL

### When to Create Emergency Checkpoints:

**Scenario 1: Major Refactoring Risk**
- **Trigger:** About to refactor >200 LOC in one session
- **Action:** Create checkpoint BEFORE starting
- **Branch:** `checkpoint/pre-[component-name]-refactor`
- **Commit:** "checkpoint: Pre-[Component] refactor safety backup"

**Scenario 2: Build Breaking Change**
- **Trigger:** About to make change that might break build
- **Action:** Create checkpoint BEFORE the change
- **Branch:** Stay on current branch
- **Commit:** "checkpoint: Working state before [risky change]"

**Scenario 3: Complex Merge**
- **Trigger:** Merging multiple feature branches
- **Action:** Create checkpoint of clean main BEFORE merge
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Commit:** "checkpoint: Clean main before [feature] merge"

**Scenario 4: External Handoff**
- **Trigger:** Sending code to external consultant for review
- **Action:** Create checkpoint of current state
- **Branch:** `checkpoint/consultant-review-[date]`
- **Commit:** "checkpoint: Code state for consultant review [date]"

**Scenario 5: Day End (Every Day)**
- **Trigger:** End of work day
- **Action:** Commit and push all work in progress
- **Branch:** Current feature branch
- **Commit:** "wip: [description] - EOD [date]"

## 🚀 PUSH STRATEGY

### When to Push:

**ALWAYS PUSH:**
1. After every checkpoint (mandatory)
2. End of day (even if work in progress)
3. Before any risky refactoring
4. After major milestone completion
5. Before asking for external review

**DON'T PUSH:**
- Code that doesn't compile (unless emergency backup)
- Code with failing tests (unless marked as WIP)
- Secrets or credentials (NEVER)

### How to Push:

**Standard Push (Checkpoint):**
```bash
git push origin [branch-name]
```

**Force Push (ONLY if you know what you're doing):**
```bash
# Only use if you've rebased and need to update remote
git push --force-with-lease origin [branch-name]
# NEVER force push to main
```

**Push with Tags (Phase Complete):**
```bash
git tag -a phase-c-v1.0 -m "Phase C Complete"
git push origin [branch-name] --tags
```

---

## 📊 PROGRESS TRACKING

### GitHub Project Board (Optional):
- **TODO:** Tasks from PHASE-C-EXECUTION-PLAN-FINAL.md
- **IN PROGRESS:** Currently working on
- **CHECKPOINT READY:** Code complete, ready to commit
- **PUSHED:** Committed and pushed to remote
- **DONE:** Merged to main

### Update HANDOFF-PHASE-C.md:
After each checkpoint, update checkboxes:
```markdown
### Phase 0: Groundwork (Day 1-2)
- [x] CI/CD pipeline configured
- [x] SwiftLint installed
- [x] LOC gate script created
- [x] 30+ baseline tests written
✅ CHECKPOINT 1 PUSHED: [commit hash]
```

---

## 🎓 GIT BEST PRACTICES

### DO:
- ✅ Commit early, commit often
- ✅ Write descriptive commit messages
- ✅ Push at every checkpoint
- ✅ Create branches for features
- ✅ Use PR reviews for major changes
- ✅ Tag releases (phase-c-v1.0)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Commit secrets or credentials
- ❌ Commit large binary files (images >1MB)
- ❌ Commit generated files (DerivedData/)
- ❌ Force push to main
- ❌ Commit broken code (unless emergency)
- ❌ Mix multiple changes in one commit

---

## 🔄 MERGE STRATEGY

### PR Review Process:
1. Push feature branch
2. Create PR on GitHub
3. Wait for CI to pass
4. Request review (if applicable)
5. Address feedback
6. Merge to main when approved

### Merge Commit Message:
```
Merge pull request #[number] from [branch]

Phase [0/1/2/3] Complete: [Brief Description]

Closes #[issue-number] (if applicable)
```

---

## 📖 SUMMARY

**7 Mandatory Checkpoints:**
0. PRE-PHASE C (RIGHT NOW)
1. Phase 0 Complete (Day 2)
2. Fasting Part 1 (Day 3)
3. Fasting Complete (Day 4)
4. Phase 1 Complete (Day 7)
5. Phase 2 Complete (Day 12)
6. UI Consistency (Day 14)
7. PHASE C COMPLETE (Day 17)

**Plus Emergency Checkpoints:**
- Before risky refactoring
