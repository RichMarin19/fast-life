## üìç PROJECT LOCATION

**Main Project Folder:**
```
/Users/richmarin/Desktop/FastingTracker/
```

**Documentation Hub:**
- All critical `.md` files are in the root of the FastingTracker folder
- Code files are in `/FastingTracker/FastingTracker/` subfolder
- Additional strategic docs in `/Users/richmarin/Desktop/Fast Life Roadmap/`

---

## üéØ YOUR MISSION

**We need your expert, unbiased evaluation of this iOS health tracking app BEFORE we begin Phase C (UI/UX Enhancement).**

### Why Your Input Matters:

1. **Triangulated Perspectives** - Product Owner has vision but explicitly requested: "My scores don't matter, I want unbiased fair evaluations with clear criteria"

2. **Evidence-Based Decisions** - We have AI Expert baseline scores (7.2/10 overall), now we need human expert validation

3. **Pre-Work Validation** - Before investing 2-4 weeks in Phase C (UI/UX polish + code refactoring), ensure we're prioritizing the right improvements

4. **Industry Standard Practice** - Apple/Google/Meta all get peer review before major initiatives

## üìã WHAT TO REVIEW (Priority Order)

### **START HERE (30 minutes)**

#### 1. **README.md** (5 min)
**Location:** `/Users/richmarin/Desktop/FastingTracker/README.md`

**What It Is:** Project overview and onboarding guide

**Why Review:**
- Does this give you sufficient context in 5 minutes?
- Is the documentation map clear?
- Can you navigate the project easily?

**Questions to Answer:**
- Can a new developer be productive in 30 minutes with this guide?
- Is anything missing or confusing?

---

#### 2. **SCORING-CRITERIA.md** (15 min)
**Location:** `/Users/richmarin/Desktop/FastingTracker/SCORING-CRITERIA.md`

**What It Is:** Standardized evaluation framework with 5 dimensions, 1-10 rubric

**Why Review:**
- **THIS IS YOUR EVALUATION TOOL** - Read this carefully before scoring anything
- Understand what "World Class (10)" vs "Very Good (7)" means
- See evidence requirements for each score level

**5 Dimensions You'll Score:**
1. **UI/UX** (25% weight) - Visual design, interactions, polish
2. **Customer Experience** (20% weight) - User journey, friction points, delight
3. **Code Quality** (25% weight) - Architecture, maintainability, LOC compliance
4. **CI/TestFlight** (15% weight) - Automation, deployment readiness
5. **Documentation** (15% weight) - Clarity, completeness, maintainability

**Questions to Answer:**
- Are the criteria fair and objective?
- Can you score confidently using this rubric?
- Are any dimensions weighted incorrectly?

---

#### 3. **TRACKER-AUDIT.md** (10 min - SKIM ONLY)
**Location:** `/Users/richmarin/Desktop/FastingTracker/TRACKER-AUDIT.md`

**What It Is:** AI Expert's baseline assessment (7.2/10 overall, 17,000+ words)

**Why Review:**
- See what the AI Expert scored
- **DO NOT let this bias your independent scoring**
- Use this later to compare perspectives and discuss divergences

**How to Use:**
- Skim the executive summary
- Note the overall 7.2/10 score and dimension breakdown
- **Close this file** - come back after you've done YOUR independent scoring

---

### **DEEP DIVE (1-2 hours)**

#### 4. **Run the App** (30 min)
**Location:** `/Users/richmarin/Desktop/FastingTracker/FastingTracker.xcodeproj`

**What to Do:**
1. Open project in Xcode 16.2+
2. Build (Cmd+B) - verify 0 errors, 0 warnings
3. Run on Simulator (Cmd+R)
4. Test ALL 5 trackers:
   - **Fasting** (main tab - ContentView)
   - **Hydration** (HydrationTrackingView)
   - **Sleep** (SleepTrackingView)
   - **Mood** (MoodTrackingView)
   - **Weight** (WeightTrackingView)

**What to Evaluate:**
- Visual consistency across trackers
- Settings gear icon placement/accessibility
- Empty states (do they guide users clearly?)
- Data entry friction (how easy to add data?)
- Visual polish (colors, spacing, typography)
- Navigation clarity
- Performance (60fps scrolling, responsive UI)

**Take Notes:**
- What feels inconsistent?
- What delights you?
- What frustrates you?
- Where do you get lost?

---

#### 5. **Review Gold Standard Code** (20 min)
**Location:** `/Users/richmarin/Desktop/FastingTracker/FastingTracker/WeightTrackingView.swift`

**What It Is:** Our "North Star" tracker - best current implementation (257 LOC)

**Why Review:**
- This is what we achieved in Phase 3a (90% LOC reduction: 2,561‚Üí257)
- See MVVM pattern, component extraction, TrackerScreenShell usage
- This is the template we plan to replicate across all trackers in Phase C

**What to Evaluate:**
- Is 257 LOC reasonable for a tracker view?
- Is the code readable and maintainable?
- Are the components well-named and focused?
- Is the MVVM separation clean?

**Lines to Focus On:**
- Lines 59-64: TrackerScreenShell pattern (reusable header)
- Lines 73-97: Component composition (CurrentWeightCard, WeightChartView, etc.)
- Lines 180-245: EmptyWeightStateView (empty state pattern)

---

#### 6. **Review Problem Code** (20 min)
**Location:** `/Users/richmarin/Desktop/FastingTracker/FastingTracker/ContentView.swift`

**What It Is:** Fasting tracker - main app view (652 LOC, needs refactoring)

**Why Review:**
- This is the MOST complex tracker (54% over target LOC)
- This is the HIGHEST RISK refactor (main user-facing view)
- Phase C.3 will reduce this from 652‚Üí300 LOC

**What to Evaluate:**
- Is 652 LOC actually a problem?
- Can you identify clear component boundaries?
- Is the complexity justified by features?
- What's the refactoring risk?

**Extraction Opportunities Identified:**
- Lines 191-276: Timer section (85 LOC) ‚Üí FastingTimerView
- Lines 285-298: Streak display (13 LOC) ‚Üí FastingStatsView
- Lines 300-338: Goal display (38 LOC) ‚Üí FastingGoalView
- Lines 341-426: Controls (85 LOC) ‚Üí FastingControlsView
- Lines 428-467: History (39 LOC) ‚Üí FastingHistoryView

---

#### 7. **Review Phase C Strategy** (20 min)
**Location:** `/Users/richmarin/Desktop/FastingTracker/HANDOFF-PHASE-C.md`

**What It Is:** Our plan for the next 2-4 weeks of work

**Why Review:**
- Understand what we're about to do
- Validate our two-phase approach (UI/UX first, code second)
- Assess risk and sequencing

**Two-Phase Approach:**

**Phase C.1: UI/UX North Star (Week 1-2)**
- Polish Weight tracker visual design
- Document visual patterns (colors, spacing, typography)
- Apply TrackerScreenShell to all trackers
- Standardize settings gear icon placement
- Add empty states (Hydration, Sleep, Mood)
- **NO code refactoring** (keep existing LOC)

**Phase C.2: Code Refactoring (Week 2-3)**
- Sleep: 304‚Üí300 LOC (LOW RISK)
- Hydration: 584‚Üí300 LOC (MEDIUM RISK)
- Fasting: 652‚Üí300 LOC (HIGH RISK)

**What to Evaluate:**
- Is this sequencing logical?
- Are the risk assessments accurate?
- Should UI/UX come before code refactoring?
- Are we missing any major risks?

---

### **OPTIONAL DEEP DIVES (30-60 min)**

#### 8. **Code Quality Standards** (15 min)
**Location:** `/Users/richmarin/Desktop/FastingTracker/CODE-QUALITY-STANDARDS.md`

**What It Is:** LOC refactoring policy and step-by-step process

**Why Review:**
- Validate our "400 LOC = mandatory refactor" policy
- Assess our "250-300 LOC target" range
- Review our performance preservation rule

**Questions to Answer:**
- Is 400 LOC a reasonable refactor trigger?
- Is 250-300 LOC achievable without harming UX?
- Are we following industry standards?

---

#### 9. **North Star Strategy** (15 min)
**Location:** `/Users/richmarin/Desktop/FastingTracker/NORTH-STAR-STRATEGY.md`

**What It Is:** Why we chose Weight (not Fasting) as the UI/UX template

**Why Review:**
- Understand our evidence-based decision
- Validate North Star selection
- See replication patterns (TrackerScreenShell, EmptyState, etc.)

**Questions to Answer:**
- Did we choose the right North Star?
- Should we use Fasting instead? (User's initial suggestion)
- Are the replication patterns sound?

---

#### 10. **Project Playbook** (15 min)
**Location:** `/Users/richmarin/Desktop/Fast Life Roadmap/FAST-LIFE-PLAYBOOK.md`

**What It Is:** Comprehensive process guide with "zoom in" (detailed) and "zoom out" (strategic) perspectives

**Why Review:**
- See our standardized processes for coding, documentation, design, testing
- Understand our decision-making framework
- Validate our "measure twice, cut once" philosophy

**Questions to Answer:**
- Are these processes reasonable?
- Are we over-engineering?
- What would you do differently?
