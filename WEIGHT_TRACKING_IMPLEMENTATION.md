## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Add Files to Xcode Project
The following files need to be added to the Xcode project target:

1. Open `FastingTracker.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Right-click the "FastingTracker" folder in the Project Navigator
3. Select "Add Files to 'FastingTracker'..."
4. Select these new files:
   - `WeightEntry.swift`
   - `WeightManager.swift`
   - `HealthKitManager.swift`
   - `WeightTrackingView.swift`
   - `AddWeightView.swift`
   - `WeightSettingsView.swift`
   - `AdvancedView.swift`
5. Ensure "Add to targets: FastingTracker" is checked
6. Click "Add"

### Step 2: Add Entitlements File
1. In Xcode, select the project in Navigator
2. Select the "FastingTracker" target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
4. Click "+ Capability"
5. Add "HealthKit"
6. Xcode should automatically link the `FastingTracker.entitlements` file
7. If not, manually set it in Build Settings ‚Üí Code Signing Entitlements

### Step 3: Verify Info.plist
1. Confirm the HealthKit usage descriptions were added
2. Located at lines 53-56 in Info.plist

### Step 4: Build and Test
```bash
cd /Users/richmarin/Desktop/FastingTracker
xcodebuild -project FastingTracker.xcodeproj -scheme FastingTracker -configuration Debug clean build
```

Or build directly in Xcode (Cmd + B)

## üì± User Experience Flow

### First Launch (Weight Tracking)
1. User taps "More" tab
2. Taps "Weight Tracking" card
3. Sees empty state with two options:
   - "Add Weight Manually" (blue button)
   - "Sync with Apple Health" (green button)

### Manual Entry
1. Tap "Add Weight Manually"
2. Fill in date and weight (required)
3. Optionally add BMI and body fat
4. Tap "Save Weight Entry"
5. Entry appears in chart and history list

### HealthKit Sync
1. Tap "Sync with Apple Health"
2. iOS prompts for HealthKit permissions
3. User grants read/write access for Weight, BMI, Body Fat
4. App syncs last 365 days of data
5. Data appears in chart and list

### Viewing Data
- **Current Weight Card**: Shows latest entry with trend
- **Chart**: Tap time range picker to filter (Week/Month/etc.)
- **Statistics**: View 7-day, 30-day changes and averages
- **History List**: Shows up to 10 most recent entries
- **Settings**: Tap gear icon to configure sync and goals

---

## üîê Privacy & Security

### HealthKit Authorization
- App requests minimal necessary permissions
- Read: Weight, BMI, Body Fat Percentage
- Write: Weight, BMI, Body Fat Percentage
- User can deny permission - manual entry still works

### Data Storage
- Local-first: All data stored in UserDefaults
- No cloud sync by default
- HealthKit sync is optional and user-controlled
- Data never leaves device unless user explicitly syncs to Apple Health

---

## üé® Design Consistency

### Color Scheme
- Primary blue: `Color(red: 0.2, green: 0.6, blue: 0.86)` (matches fasting app theme)
- Goal line: Green dashed line
- Trend indicators: Green (down), Red (up)
- Card backgrounds: `Color(.systemBackground)` with subtle shadows

### SF Symbols Used
- `scalemass.fill` - Weight tracking icon
- `heart.fill` - Apple Health
- `plus.circle.fill` - Add weight
- `gear` - Settings
- `calendar` - Date-related stats
- `chart.bar` - Statistics
- `arrow.up.right` / `arrow.down.right` - Trends

---

## üîÑ Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

### Tier 1 Features (Planned)
1. **Mood & Energy Tracker**
   - Daily check-in with 1-10 slider
   - Correlate with fasting data

2. **Hydration Tracker**
   - Water intake logging
   - Optional reminders

3. **Data Export & Backup**
   - CSV export functionality
   - iCloud backup option

### Renpho Scale Integration (Research Needed)
- **Status**: Not yet implemented
- **Approach**: HealthKit intermediary recommended
  - Renpho app ‚Üí Apple Health ‚Üí Fast LIFe
  - Works with all WiFi scales that sync to Apple Health
- **Alternative**: Direct Renpho SDK integration (if public API available)

## üìä Technical Specifications

### Data Model
```swift
struct WeightEntry: Codable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let date: Date
    let weight: Double  // pounds
    let bmi: Double?    // body mass index
    let bodyFat: Double?  // percentage
    let source: WeightSource
}

enum WeightSource: String, Codable {
    case manual = "Manual Entry"
    case healthKit = "Apple Health"
    case renpho = "Renpho Scale"
    case other = "Other Scale"
}
```

### HealthKit Identifiers
- `.bodyMass` - Weight in pounds
- `.bodyMassIndex` - BMI
- `.bodyFatPercentage` - Body fat percentage (0.0-1.0 decimal)

### Charts Framework
- SwiftUI Charts (iOS 16+)
- LineMark for trend line
- PointMark for data points
- RuleMark for goal line
- Interactive time range filtering

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Renpho Direct Integration**
   - Not implemented yet
   - Works via HealthKit intermediary
   - User must have Renpho app installed and synced

2. **Unit Support**
   - Currently only supports pounds (lbs)
   - Metric (kg) support can be added in future update

3. **Data Limit**
   - No artificial limit on stored entries
   - Chart performance tested up to 365 entries
   - May need pagination for multi-year datasets

## üìû Support Notes

### If Build Fails
1. Check all new Swift files are added to target
2. Verify HealthKit capability is enabled in Signing & Capabilities
3. Ensure entitlements file is linked
4. Clean build folder (Cmd + Shift + K) and rebuild

### If HealthKit Authorization Fails
1. Check Info.plist has usage descriptions
2. Verify HealthKit capability in entitlements
3. Test on real device (HealthKit doesn't work in Simulator for all features)
4. Check iOS version is 15.0+

### If Charts Don't Display
1. Ensure iOS deployment target is 16.0+ (Charts framework requirement)
2. Verify data exists in selected time range
3. Check weight entries have valid dates and weights

## üéì Code Architecture

### MVVM Pattern
- **Models**: `WeightEntry`, `WeightSource`
- **ViewModels**: `WeightManager`, `HealthKitManager`
- **Views**: `WeightTrackingView`, `AddWeightView`, `WeightSettingsView`

### ObservableObject Pattern
- `WeightManager` publishes changes to `weightEntries` and `syncWithHealthKit`
- Views automatically update when data changes
- Ensures UI consistency across app

### Singleton Pattern
- `HealthKitManager.shared` provides centralized HealthKit access
- Prevents multiple authorization requests
- Maintains authorization state

---

## üìù User Documentation Needed

Add to App Store description:
- Track your weight progress alongside fasting
- Sync with Apple Health for automatic updates
- View trends and statistics over time
- Set weight goals and visualize progress
- Manual entry option for users without smart scales

Add to FEATURES.md:
- Weight Tracking section
- HealthKit Integration section
- Update version to 1.1.0
