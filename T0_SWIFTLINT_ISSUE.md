# T0 SwiftLint SourceKit Issue

## Problem
SwiftLint 0.61.0 fails with SourceKittenFramework fatal error:
```
SourceKittenFramework/library_wrapper.swift:58: Fatal error: Loading sourcekitdInProc.framework/Versions/A/sourcekitdInProc failed
```

## Root Cause
- Using Command Line Tools instead of full Xcode
- SourceKit framework compatibility issue with M1/ARM64 architecture
- SwiftLint version 0.61.0 may have regression with SourceKit integration

## Attempted Solutions
1. ‚úÖ Created .swiftlint.yml config
2. ‚úÖ Moved analyzer rules (unused_import) to separate section
3. ‚úÖ Created minimal config without SourceKit-dependent rules
4. ‚ùå SwiftLint still fails on basic rules due to SourceKit loading issue

## Workaround for T0 Completion
Since SwiftFormat is working (59/59 files formatted successfully):
1. ‚úÖ Config files created (.swiftformat + .swiftlint.yml)
2. ‚úÖ Baseline formatting commit applied
3. üîÑ Add Xcode Run Script Phase for SwiftFormat (linting alternative)

## Future Resolution
- Install full Xcode instead of Command Line Tools
- Downgrade SwiftLint to stable version (0.54.0)
- Use CI-based linting instead of local SourceKit
