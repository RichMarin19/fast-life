# HealthKit Auto-Sync Implementation

## Overview
Implemented automatic synchronization of weight data from Apple HealthKit without requiring manual sync button press. The app now automatically detects new weight entries added to HealthKit (e.g., from smart scales) and updates the Fast LIFe app in real-time.

## Changes Made

### 1. WeightManager.swift
**Added automatic sync on app launch:**
- Import HealthKit framework
- Added `observerQuery` property to track active observer
- Modified `init()` to automatically sync from HealthKit on launch if authorized and enabled
- Added `setupHealthKitObserver()` call in init to enable real-time updates
- Added `deinit` to properly clean up observer when manager is deallocated

**Added HealthKit Observer:**
- New `setupHealthKitObserver()` method that:
  - Creates HKObserverQuery for bodyMass (weight) data
  - Automatically triggers sync when new weight data is detected in HealthKit
  - Properly handles cleanup of existing observers
  - Only runs when sync is enabled and HealthKit is authorized

**Updated setSyncPreference():**
- Now calls `setupHealthKitObserver()` when sync is enabled
- Stops observer and cleans up when sync is disabled
- Ensures observer is set up after HealthKit authorization

### 2. HealthKitManager.swift
**Added Observer Management Methods:**
- `startObserving(query:)`:
  - Executes the observer query
  - Enables background delivery for weight data with `.immediate` frequency
  - Allows app to receive weight updates even when not in foreground

- `stopObserving(query:)`:
  - Stops the observer query
  - Disables background delivery to conserve battery when not needed

### 3. Info.plist
**Added Background Modes:**
- Added `UIBackgroundModes` key with `processing` value
- Required for HealthKit background delivery to work
- Allows app to receive HealthKit updates in the background

## How It Works

### Initial Sync (App Launch)
1. App launches
2. WeightManager.init() is called
3. If sync is enabled AND HealthKit is authorized:
   - Automatically calls `syncFromHealthKit()`
   - Fetches last 365 days of weight data
   - Merges with local entries (avoiding duplicates)

### Real-Time Updates (Background)
1. User weighs themselves on smart scale
2. Scale app syncs weight to HealthKit
3. HealthKit notifies Fast LIFe via HKObserverQuery
4. Observer handler automatically calls `syncFromHealthKit()`
5. New weight data appears in Fast LIFe without user intervention

### Deduplication Logic
The sync process prevents duplicates by checking:
- Same source (.healthKit)
- Same timestamp (within 1 minute)
- Same weight value (within 0.1 lbs)

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- User weighs themselves
- Weight appears in scale app
- Scale app syncs to HealthKit
- User opens Fast LIFe
- **User must tap "Sync Weight with Apple Health" button**
- Weight finally appears in Fast LIFe

### After:
- User weighs themselves
- Weight appears in scale app
- Scale app syncs to HealthKit
- **Fast LIFe automatically detects new weight**
- User opens Fast LIFe
- **Weight is already there!**

## Technical Details

### HKObserverQuery
- Monitors HealthKit for changes to specific data types (bodyMass)
- Runs in background when configured properly
- Triggers callback when new data is detected
- Must call completion handler to maintain background updates

### Background Delivery
- `.immediate` frequency = fastest possible updates
- Requires `UIBackgroundModes` in Info.plist
- System manages battery impact automatically
- Can be disabled when sync preference is turned off

### Memory Management
- Weak self references prevent retain cycles
- Observer properly cleaned up in deinit
- Background delivery disabled when not needed

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test automatic sync on launch:**
   - Add weight entry to Health app while Fast LIFe is closed
   - Open Fast LIFe
   - Verify weight appears immediately without manual sync

2. **Test background updates:**
   - Open Fast LIFe
   - Without closing it, add weight to Health app from another app
   - Check if weight appears in Fast LIFe within a few seconds

3. **Test sync toggle:**
   - Disable "Sync with Apple Health" in settings
   - Add weight to Health app
   - Verify it does NOT appear in Fast LIFe
   - Re-enable sync
   - Verify weight now appears

4. **Test deduplication:**
   - Sync multiple times
   - Verify no duplicate entries are created

## Performance Impact

- **Launch time:** Minimal - sync runs asynchronously
- **Battery:** Minimal - system optimizes background delivery
- **Network:** None - all data is local on device
- **Storage:** None - same data already in HealthKit

## Permissions Required

All permissions already exist in Info.plist:
- `NSHealthShareUsageDescription` - Read weight data
- `NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription` - Write weight data
- `UIBackgroundModes` - Background updates (newly added)

## Backward Compatibility

- Manual sync button still works
- No changes to data format
- Existing weight entries unaffected
- Works with iOS 16+ (same as before)
