# New Features Added ‚ú®

## 7. Mood & Energy Tracker üòä‚ö°

**Added:** January 3, 2025
**Version:** 1.2.0 (Build 8)

### What Changed:

Complete mood and energy tracking system with 1-10 scale rating and trend visualization:

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ 1-10 scale sliders for mood and energy levels
- ‚úÖ Live emoji feedback (üò¢‚ÜíüòÑ for mood, üîã‚Üí‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° for energy)
- ‚úÖ Color-coded progress rings (red‚Üígreen gradient)
- ‚úÖ Embedded trend graphs (Mood in orange, Energy in blue)
- ‚úÖ Multiple time ranges (7/30/90 days)
- ‚úÖ 7-day average statistics
- ‚úÖ Optional notes for context
- ‚úÖ Recent entries list with delete
- ‚úÖ UserDefaults persistence (no HealthKit)

**How It Works:**
1. Go to More ‚Üí Mood & Energy Tracker
2. Tap "+" button to log entry
3. Adjust Mood slider (1-10) ‚Üí emoji/color updates live
4. Adjust Energy slider (1-10) ‚Üí emoji/color updates live
5. Add optional notes
6. Tap "Save" ‚Üí See entry in list with graphs below

**UI/UX Design:**
- **Layout Pattern**: Matches Weight Tracker (single ScrollView, no tabs)
- **Structure**: Circles ‚Üí Averages ‚Üí Graphs ‚Üí Recent Entries
- **Graphs**: Swift Charts with catmullRom interpolation for smooth curves
- **Time Picker**: Segmented control (7/30/90 days) updates both graphs
- **Progress Rings**: Animated fill based on 1-10 level

**Technical Implementation:**
- `MoodEntry.swift`: Data model with emoji/color helpers
- `MoodManager.swift`: ObservableObject with statistics methods
- `MoodTrackingView.swift`: Main view with embedded graphs
- Updated `AdvancedView.swift`: Added navigation + Settings clear data

**Data Structure:**
```swift
struct MoodEntry: Codable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let date: Date
    let moodLevel: Int      // 1-10 scale
    let energyLevel: Int    // 1-10 scale
    let notes: String?

    var moodEmoji: String   // üò¢‚ÜíüòÑ
    var energyEmoji: String // üîã‚Üí‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°
    var moodColor: Color    // red‚Üígreen
    var energyColor: Color  // red‚Üígreen
}
```

**Why No HealthKit Integration:**
- User decision to start without HealthKit
- iOS 17+ has `stateOfMind` type, but not necessary for v1
- Can be added in future if users request it (will poll in beta)
- Keeps implementation simple and focused

**Settings Integration:**
- "Clear All Mood Data" button in Danger Zone
- Included in "Clear All Data and Reset"
- Two-step confirmation (follows safety pattern)

**Commit:** `ab05e30` - "Add Mood & Energy Tracker feature (v1.2.0)"

## 6. Hydration Sync Timing & App Reset UX Improvements üîÑ‚ú®

**Added:** January 2, 2025
**Version:** 1.1.5 (Build 7)

### What Changed:

#### A. Fixed Hydration Sync Data Accuracy
The hydration sync now waits for actual import completion before showing success message, ensuring accurate drink counts from HealthKit.

**Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** UI showed old count (e.g., 44 oz) because arbitrary 1.5s delay didn't wait for async import
- **After:** UI shows correct imported total (e.g., 108 oz) after import completes

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added completion handler to `HydrationManager.syncFromHealthKit()`
- Replaced time-based delays with actual async completion callbacks
- Follows Apple HealthKit Framework async operation best practices

#### B. Smooth App Reset Experience
"Clear All Data and Reset" now smoothly transitions to onboarding instead of force-closing the app.

**Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** App called `exit(0)` which crashed the app (violates Apple guidelines)
- **After:** Settings dismisses, then onboarding appears smoothly via state management

**Technical Implementation:**
- Removed `exit(0)` call (per Apple HIG: "Don't quit an iOS app programmatically")
- Implemented SwiftUI state-driven reset with `shouldResetToOnboarding` binding
- Proper navigation dismiss followed by state trigger

**Commit:** `bf1ac0d` - "fix(hydration): sync timing and app reset UX improvements"

## 5. Separate Sync Controls for Weight and Hydration üîÑ

**Added:** January 1, 2025
**Version:** 1.1.5 (Build 7)

### What Changed:

Three independent sync buttons in Settings with separate dialog options:

1. **Sync Weight with Apple Health** (Blue icon)
   - Sync All Data: Import all weight history
   - Sync Future Data Only: Sync from today forward

2. **Sync Hydration with Apple Health** (Cyan icon)
   - Sync All Data: Import all water history
   - Sync Future Data Only: Sync from today forward

3. **Sync All Health Data** (Green icon) - NEW
   - Sync All Data: Import both weight and hydration history
   - Sync Future Data Only: Sync both from today forward

### Technical Implementation:
- Separate state variables: `isSyncingWeight`, `isSyncingHydration`, `isSyncingAll`
- Three independent `confirmationDialog` views
- Prevents UI conflicts (both buttons showing "Syncing..." simultaneously)
- Each sync type has its own completion flow

**Commit:** `48e3eb7` - "feat(settings): separate weight and hydration sync controls"

---

## 4. HealthKit Water/Hydration Tracking Integration üíßüçé

**Added:** December 31, 2024
**Version:** 1.1.4

### What Changed:

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ All drink types (water, coffee, tea) sync to HealthKit as water intake
- ‚úÖ Automatic sync when adding drinks (if HealthKit authorized)
- ‚úÖ Manual sync option in Settings
- ‚úÖ Import water data from HealthKit to app
- ‚úÖ Water-specific authorization checks

**How It Works:**
1. Grant water permissions in Settings > Health > Apps > Fast LIFe
2. Add any drink (water, coffee, tea) ‚Üí Automatically syncs to Apple Health
3. Use "Sync Hydration with Apple Health" to import existing water data

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `HKQuantityTypeIdentifier.dietaryWater`
- Unit: `HKUnit.fluidOunceUS()`
- Methods: `saveWater()`, `fetchWaterData()`, `isWaterAuthorized()`
- Auto-sync in `HydrationManager.addDrinkEntry()`

**Commit:** `[version 1.1.4 commits]` - HealthKit water tracking integration

1. **Calendar View** - Tap any day ‚Üí Edit Fast ‚Üí Delete button
2. **Recent Fasts List** - Tap any fast ‚Üí Edit Fast ‚Üí Delete button

#### B. Intelligent Month View Default
Fasting Progress Month view now **intelligently defaults** to the most recent month with data instead of always showing the current month.

---

### Feature Details:

#### üóëÔ∏è Delete Fast Functionality

**How It Works:**

1. **From Calendar:**
   - Tap any day with a fast (üî• or ‚ùå)
   - Opens "Edit Fast" view
   - Scroll down ‚Üí See red "Delete Fast" button
   - Tap Delete ‚Üí Confirmation alert appears
   - Confirm ‚Üí Fast permanently deleted

2. **From Recent Fasts List:**
   - Tap any fast in the list

   - Red "Delete Fast" button at bottom
   - Tap Delete ‚Üí Confirmation alert appears
   - Confirm ‚Üí Fast permanently deleted

**Confirmation Alert:**
```
Delete Fast
Are you sure you want to delete this fast?
This action cannot be undone.

[Cancel] [Delete]
```

---

#### üìÖ Intelligent Month View Default

**Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** On Oct 1, Month view showed "October 2025" with "No data available" even though latest fast was Sep 30
- **After:** Month view intelligently shows "September 2025" (where the data is)

**How It Works:**

1. User opens History ‚Üí Taps "Month" view
2. App checks: Does current month have any fasting data?
3. **If YES:** Show current month (normal behavior)
4. **If NO:** Find most recent month with data and show that month
5. User can still navigate forward/backward with arrow buttons

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Current Month Has Data**
- Date: Oct 15, 2025
- Last fast: Oct 10, 2025
- **Result:** Shows "October 2025" ‚úÖ

**Scenario 2: Current Month Empty**
- Date: Oct 1, 2025
- Last fast: Sep 30, 2025
- **Result:** Shows "September 2025" (where data is) ‚úÖ

**Scenario 3: Multiple Months Gap**
- Date: Dec 1, 2025
- Last fast: Sep 15, 2025
- **Result:** Shows "September 2025" (jumps back 3 months) ‚úÖ

**Technical Details:**
- Only initializes once when switching to Month view
- Doesn't interfere with manual navigation (arrows still work)
- Respects 12-month history limit (won't go back more than 11 months)
- Uses Calendar API for accurate month calculations

---

### Files Modified

#### 1. **FastingManager.swift**
**New Method Added:**
```swift
func deleteFast(for date: Date) {
    let calendar = Calendar.current
    let targetDay = calendar.startOfDay(for: date)

    // Remove the fast for this day
    fastingHistory.removeAll { session in
        calendar.startOfDay(for: session.startTime) == targetDay
    }

    // Recalculate streaks from history
    calculateStreakFromHistory()

    saveHistory()
}
```

**Why This Design:**
- Uses date-based deletion (deletes fast for entire day)
- Automatically recalculates streaks (important for data integrity)
- Saves to UserDefaults immediately
- Follows existing pattern of other FastingManager methods

#### 2. **HistoryView.swift**

**A. AddEditFastView - Delete Button:**
- Added `@State private var showingDeleteAlert` for alert state

**B. Recent Fasts List - Tap Gesture:**
- Removed broken swipe actions (didn't work in VStack)
- Added `.contentShape(Rectangle())` for full-width tapping
- Added `.onTapGesture` to open Edit Fast view

**C. FastingGraphView - Intelligent Month View:**
- Added `initializeMonthView()` function
- Calls initialization when user switches to Month view
- Checks current month for data
- Finds most recent month with data if current is empty
- Sets `selectedMonthOffset` to show correct month

---

### API Changes

**New Public Method:**
```swift
// FastingManager.swift
func deleteFast(for date: Date)
```

**Parameters:**
- `date: Date` - The date of the fast to delete (uses start date)

**Behavior:**

---

### Design Decisions

#### Why Delete by Date (Not by ID)?
- Existing pattern: One fast per day
- Matches calendar selection behavior
- Simpler user mental model
- Consistent with addManualFast logic

#### Why Confirmation Alert?
- Follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- Prevents accidental data loss
- Standard iOS pattern (Mail, Photos, etc.)
- "Cancel" is safe default (left position)

#### Why Tap Instead of Swipe?
- Swipe actions require List view (not VStack)
- Would require refactoring working UI
- Tap is more discoverable
- Consistent with calendar tap behavior
- Simpler implementation

#### Why Intelligent Month View?
- Better first-time user experience
- Reduces confusion ("Where's my data?")
- Follows principle of least surprise
- Common pattern in analytics apps

---

### Known Limitations

- Delete is permanent (no undo function)
- Can only delete one fast at a time
- Month view limited to 12 months back
- Delete doesn't sync to HealthKit (if implemented later)

---

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Batch delete (select multiple fasts)
- [ ] Undo delete (with timeout)
- [ ] Delete confirmation preference (disable alert)
- [ ] Export before delete (data backup)
- [ ] Soft delete with trash bin
- [ ] Year/All view intelligent defaults
