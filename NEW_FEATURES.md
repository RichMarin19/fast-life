# New Features Added ✨

## 1. Current Month Calendar View 📅

### What Changed:
- **Before:** Calendar showed last 28 days (4 weeks rolling)
- **After:** Calendar shows the **current month** (e.g., "January 2025")

### Features:
- ✅ Displays full current month (28-31 days depending on month)
- ✅ Proper alignment - empty cells for days before month starts
- ✅ Shows month and year in header (e.g., "🔥 January 2025")
- ✅ All days of current month visible
- ✅ Auto-updates when month changes

### Calendar Layout:
```
🔥 January 2025                    5 days

S   M   T   W   T   F   S
            1   2   3   4   5
    🔥  🔥  ❌  ⚪  🔥  🔥

6   7   8   9   10  11  12
🔥  ⚪  🔥  🔥  ❌  ⚪  🔥

... (continues for entire month)
```

## 2. Edit Fast Times When Stopping ⏰

### What Changed:
When you tap "Stop Fast" and confirm, you now get **3 options**:
1. **Cancel** - Keep fasting
2. **Edit Times** - Adjust start/end times before stopping
3. **Stop** - End fast with current times

### Edit Times Screen:
Shows a form with:
- **Start Time Picker** - Adjust when you actually started
- **End Time Picker** - Adjust when you actually ended
- **Duration Display** - Shows calculated duration (e.g., "20h 15m")
- **Save & Stop Fast** button (red)

### Use Cases:

**Scenario 1: Forgot to Start Timer**
- You started fasting at 6:00 PM yesterday
- Forgot to tap "Start Fast" until 7:00 PM
- Stop fast → Edit Times → Set start to 6:00 PM ✅

**Scenario 2: Adjust End Time**
- You broke your fast at 2:00 PM
- Didn't stop timer until 3:00 PM
- Stop fast → Edit Times → Set end to 2:00 PM ✅

**Scenario 3: Backdating Fasts**
- You fasted yesterday but forgot to track it
- Start fast → Stop fast → Edit Times
- Change both start and end to yesterday ✅

### How It Works:

1. **Tap "Stop Fast"** (red button)
2. **Alert appears:** "Stop Fast?"
   - Message: "Do you want to edit the start/end times before stopping?"
3. **Choose an option:**
   - **Cancel** → Returns to timer (fast continues)
   - **Edit Times** → Opens time editor
   - **Stop** → Ends fast immediately with current times

4. **In Time Editor (if you chose Edit):**
   - Adjust start date/time
   - Adjust end date/time
   - See live duration calculation
   - Tap "Save & Stop Fast" to finalize
   - Or tap "Cancel" to go back

### Technical Details:

**Time Pickers:**
- Full date and time selection
- Supports past dates
- Hour and minute precision
- 12/24 hour format (follows device settings)

**Duration Calculation:**
- Automatically updates as you change times
- Shows "Invalid time range" if end is before start
- Format: "Xh Xm" (e.g., "20h 30m")

**Streak Impact:**
- Edited times affect whether goal was met
- Streak calculated based on edited duration
- Proper calendar day assignment
