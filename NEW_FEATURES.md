# New Features Added ✨

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE

**UI OVERLAY PROHIBITION:** UI elements (buttons, text, page indicators, navigation controls) must NEVER overlap under ANY circumstances.

**Before Adding Features:**
- ✅ Test on ALL device sizes (iPhone SE, standard, Pro Max)
- ✅ Test with keyboard open AND closed
- ✅ Test ALL navigation paths (forward/backward)
- ✅ Verify NO overlapping in ANY state

**Reference:** See `HANDOFF.md` for detailed overlay prevention protocols.

## 9. Educational Fasting Timeline 🕐🎓

**Added:** January 4, 2025
**Version:** 1.2.1 (Build 9)

### What Changed:

Interactive educational timeline showing what happens in your body during fasting, integrated directly into the Timer screen and Insights tab.

**Features:**
- ✅ Educational stage icons positioned around timer circle
- ✅ Smart filtering: Only shows stages relevant to your goal (18h goal = 5 icons)
- ✅ Tap any icon for instant educational popover with metabolic details
- ✅ 9 fasting stages from Fed State (0-4h) to Prolonged Fast (48+h)
- ✅ New "Timeline" section in Insights tab with all stages
- ✅ Expandable cards with descriptions and "Did You Know?" facts
- ✅ Improved Timer screen spacing (title up, goal/buttons down)

**How It Works:**
1. **On Timer Screen:** Icons appear around the progress ring at relevant hour angles
2. **Tap Icon:** Beautiful popover shows stage title, metabolic changes, educational facts
3. **In Insights Tab:** Navigate to "Timeline" tab for full educational reference

### Educational Content (9 Stages):

1. **🍽️ Fed State (0-4h)**: Digestion active, blood sugar and insulin elevated
2. **🔄 Post-Absorptive State (4-8h)**: Insulin drops, fat burning begins
3. **⚡ Early Fasting (8-12h)**: Liver glycogen depleting, fat breakdown ramps up
4. **🔥 Fat-Burning Mode (12-16h)**: Insulin stays low, ketone production starts
5. **🧠 Ketone Production Rises (16-20h)**: Mental clarity, steady fat burning
6. **💪 Deeper Fasting (20-24h)**: Growth hormone rises, autophagy begins
7. **🧬 Strong Metabolic Shift (24-36h)**: Ketones are major fuel, autophagy continues
8. **🔬 Deep Autophagy + Repair (36-48h)**: Cell cleanup, inflammation lowers, immune refresh
9. **⭐ Prolonged Fast Territory (48+h)**: Stem cells activate, deep repair (medical supervision recommended)

### UI/UX Improvements:

**Timer Screen:**
- Top spacer reduced from 70pt → 30pt (title moves up)
- Progress percentage bottom padding increased 15pt → 40pt (goal/buttons move down)
- Icons positioned using trigonometry: `angle = (midpointHour / 24) * 360° - 90°`
- Icons render at 160pt radius from timer center
- White circle background with subtle shadow for visibility

**Educational Popover:**
- Clean NavigationView presentation
- Icon + title + hour range header
- "What's Happening" section with bullet points (blue background)
- "Did You Know?" section with lightbulb icon (yellow background)
- "Done" button to dismiss

**Insights Timeline Section:**
- New "Timeline" tab in segmented picker
- All 9 stages in expandable cards
- Tap to expand/collapse with smooth spring animation
- Shows icon, title, hour range, descriptions, facts
- Consistent design with other Insights sections

### Technical Implementation:

**Files Added:**
```
FastingStage.swift
- Identifiable struct with id, hourRange, title, icon, description[], didYouKnow, startHour, endHour
- Static array of 9 stages
- relevantStages(for:) helper method filters by goal

FastingStageDetailView.swift
- Educational popover view
- ScrollView with NavigationView presentation
- Color-coded sections (blue for info, yellow for facts)
```

**Files Modified:**
```
ContentView.swift (lines 10, 31-109, 311-313)
- Added @State selectedStage property
- Added ForEach loop around timer rendering stage icons at calculated positions
- Added .sheet(item:) for educational popover
- Improved spacing (30pt top, 40pt bottom padding)

InsightsView.swift (lines 41-272)
- Added "timeline" case to InsightSection enum
- Added FastingTimelineSection view
- Added TimelineStageCard expandable component
- Uses same expandable pattern as FAQ section

project.pbxproj
- Registered FastingStage.swift and FastingStageDetailView.swift
- Added to PBXBuildFile, PBXFileReference, PBXGroup, PBXSourcesBuildPhase
```

### Why This Matters:

**Educational Value:**
- Users learn metabolic science while tracking
- Demystifies what's happening in their body
- Motivates continued fasting with knowledge
- Evidence-based information at fingertips

**UX Excellence:**
- < 2 clicks to access any stage info (tap icon on timer)
- Progressive disclosure (icons → tap → popover)
- Contextual help (Apple HIG compliant)
- Clean visual hierarchy with icons and colors

**Design Philosophy:**
- Education integrated into experience, not separate
- Non-intrusive (icons don't clutter timer)
- Goal-aware (only relevant stages shown)
- Scalable (works for 8h to 48h+ goals)

### Apple HIG References:

**Contextual Help:**
> "Provide context to help users understand app functionality"
> https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/help

**Progressive Disclosure:**

## 8. Hydration Default & Keyboard Performance Fix 💧⚡

**Fixed:** January 3, 2025
**Version:** 1.2.1 (Build 9)

### What Changed:

Fixed hydration default recommendation and restored original keyboard performance after optimization attempt backfired.

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Hydration default changed from 90 oz to 100 oz
2. ✅ Updated copy text to "100 oz Recommended for Most People"
3. ✅ Restored keyboard loading speed by reverting .task to .onAppear pattern
4. ✅ Added defensive check to ensure Fasting Goal "16" default displays

### Problem Solved:

**Issue:** Previous optimization changed `.onAppear` to `.task` for auto-focus, which actually made keyboard loading SLOWER (~2 seconds lag instead of instant).

**Root Cause:** `.task` runs asynchronously and only once per view lifecycle, causing keyboard initialization conflicts and breaking back navigation cursor refocus.

**Fix:** Reverted ALL `.task` modifiers back to `.onAppear` (original working pattern that loaded keyboard instantly).

### Technical Details:

**Hydration Changes:**
```swift
// State initialization (OnboardingView.swift lines 11-12)
@State private var hydrationGoal: Double = 100  // Changed from 90
@State private var hydrationGoalText: String = "100"  // Changed from "90"

// Copy text (line 444)
Text("100 oz Recommended for Most People")  // Was "90 oz"
```

**Keyboard Performance:**
- Kept `.onAppear { isFocused = true }` pattern on all 4 input pages
- This ensures instant keyboard appearance without async delays
- Per Apple HIG: "Minimize user effort during onboarding by anticipating needs"
- Reference: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/onboarding

**TabView Optimization:**
- Simplified from `.page(indexDisplayMode: .always)` to `.page`
- Enables lazy page rendering while maintaining visible page indicators
- Colors set via `UIPageControl.appearance()` in `init()`
- Per Apple: "A paged view shows page indicators at the bottom by default"
- Reference: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/pagetabviewstyle

### Why 100 oz Instead of 90 oz:

User research indicated 100 oz is more accurate general recommendation for most people than 90 oz. Weight-based calculation (weight/2) was considered but deemed less accurate than fixed 100 oz recommendation.

### Files Modified:

- `OnboardingView.swift`: Hydration defaults, copy text, TabView style
- Lines changed: 11-12 (state), 64 (TabView), 328-333 (fasting defensive check), 444 (copy text)

**Commit:** `76fdadf` - "fix: update hydration default to 100 oz and restore keyboard performance"

## 7. Mood & Energy Tracker 😊⚡

**Added:** January 3, 2025
**Version:** 1.2.0 (Build 8)

### What Changed:

Complete mood and energy tracking system with 1-10 scale rating and trend visualization:

**Features:**
- ✅ 1-10 scale sliders for mood and energy levels
- ✅ Live emoji feedback (😢→😄 for mood, 🔋→⚡⚡⚡ for energy)
- ✅ Color-coded progress rings (red→green gradient)
- ✅ Embedded trend graphs (Mood in orange, Energy in blue)
- ✅ Multiple time ranges (7/30/90 days)
- ✅ 7-day average statistics
- ✅ Optional notes for context
- ✅ Recent entries list with delete
- ✅ UserDefaults persistence (no HealthKit)

**How It Works:**
1. Go to More → Mood & Energy Tracker
2. Tap "+" button to log entry
3. Adjust Mood slider (1-10) → emoji/color updates live
4. Adjust Energy slider (1-10) → emoji/color updates live
5. Add optional notes
6. Tap "Save" → See entry in list with graphs below

**UI/UX Design:**
- **Layout Pattern**: Matches Weight Tracker (single ScrollView, no tabs)
- **Structure**: Circles → Averages → Graphs → Recent Entries
- **Graphs**: Swift Charts with catmullRom interpolation for smooth curves
- **Time Picker**: Segmented control (7/30/90 days) updates both graphs
- **Progress Rings**: Animated fill based on 1-10 level

**Technical Implementation:**
- `MoodEntry.swift`: Data model with emoji/color helpers
- `MoodManager.swift`: ObservableObject with statistics methods
- `MoodTrackingView.swift`: Main view with embedded graphs
- Updated `AdvancedView.swift`: Added navigation + Settings clear data

**Data Structure:**
```swift
struct MoodEntry: Codable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let date: Date
    let moodLevel: Int      // 1-10 scale
    let energyLevel: Int    // 1-10 scale
    let notes: String?

    var moodEmoji: String   // 😢→😄
    var energyEmoji: String // 🔋→⚡⚡⚡
    var moodColor: Color    // red→green
    var energyColor: Color  // red→green
}
```

**Why No HealthKit Integration:**
- User decision to start without HealthKit
- iOS 17+ has `stateOfMind` type, but not necessary for v1
- Can be added in future if users request it (will poll in beta)
- Keeps implementation simple and focused

**Settings Integration:**
- "Clear All Mood Data" button in Danger Zone
- Included in "Clear All Data and Reset"
- Two-step confirmation (follows safety pattern)

**Commit:** `ab05e30` - "Add Mood & Energy Tracker feature (v1.2.0)"

## 6. Hydration Sync Timing & App Reset UX Improvements 🔄✨

**Added:** January 2, 2025
**Version:** 1.1.5 (Build 7)

### What Changed:

#### A. Fixed Hydration Sync Data Accuracy
The hydration sync now waits for actual import completion before showing success message, ensuring accurate drink counts from HealthKit.

**Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** UI showed old count (e.g., 44 oz) because arbitrary 1.5s delay didn't wait for async import
- **After:** UI shows correct imported total (e.g., 108 oz) after import completes

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added completion handler to `HydrationManager.syncFromHealthKit()`
- Replaced time-based delays with actual async completion callbacks
- Follows Apple HealthKit Framework async operation best practices

#### B. Smooth App Reset Experience
"Clear All Data and Reset" now smoothly transitions to onboarding instead of force-closing the app.

**Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** App called `exit(0)` which crashed the app (violates Apple guidelines)
- **After:** Settings dismisses, then onboarding appears smoothly via state management

**Technical Implementation:**
- Removed `exit(0)` call (per Apple HIG: "Don't quit an iOS app programmatically")
- Implemented SwiftUI state-driven reset with `shouldResetToOnboarding` binding
- Proper navigation dismiss followed by state trigger

**Commit:** `bf1ac0d` - "fix(hydration): sync timing and app reset UX improvements"

## 5. Separate Sync Controls for Weight and Hydration 🔄

**Added:** January 1, 2025
**Version:** 1.1.5 (Build 7)

### What Changed:

Three independent sync buttons in Settings with separate dialog options:

1. **Sync Weight with Apple Health** (Blue icon)
   - Sync All Data: Import all weight history
   - Sync Future Data Only: Sync from today forward

2. **Sync Hydration with Apple Health** (Cyan icon)
   - Sync All Data: Import all water history
   - Sync Future Data Only: Sync from today forward

3. **Sync All Health Data** (Green icon) - NEW
   - Sync All Data: Import both weight and hydration history
   - Sync Future Data Only: Sync both from today forward

### Technical Implementation:
- Separate state variables: `isSyncingWeight`, `isSyncingHydration`, `isSyncingAll`
- Three independent `confirmationDialog` views
- Prevents UI conflicts (both buttons showing "Syncing..." simultaneously)
- Each sync type has its own completion flow

**Commit:** `48e3eb7` - "feat(settings): separate weight and hydration sync controls"

---

## 4. HealthKit Water/Hydration Tracking Integration 💧🍎

**Added:** December 31, 2024
**Version:** 1.1.4

- ✅ Automatic sync when adding drinks (if HealthKit authorized)
- ✅ Manual sync option in Settings
- ✅ Import water data from HealthKit to app
- ✅ Water-specific authorization checks

**How It Works:**
1. Grant water permissions in Settings > Health > Apps > Fast LIFe
2. Add any drink (water, coffee, tea) → Automatically syncs to Apple Health
3. Use "Sync Hydration with Apple Health" to import existing water data

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `HKQuantityTypeIdentifier.dietaryWater`
- Unit: `HKUnit.fluidOunceUS()`
- Methods: `saveWater()`, `fetchWaterData()`, `isWaterAuthorized()`
- Auto-sync in `HydrationManager.addDrinkEntry()`

**Commit:** `[version 1.1.4 commits]` - HealthKit water tracking integration

## 1. Delete Fast Functionality & Intelligent Month View 🗑️📅

**Added:** January 1, 2025
**Version:** 1.0.7

### What Changed:

#### A. Delete Fast from Calendar & Recent Fasts
Users can now **delete fasting sessions** from two locations:
1. **Calendar View** - Tap any day → Edit Fast → Delete button
2. **Recent Fasts List** - Tap any fast → Edit Fast → Delete button

#### B. Intelligent Month View Default
Fasting Progress Month view now **intelligently defaults** to the most recent month with data instead of always showing the current month.

---

### Feature Details:

#### 🗑️ Delete Fast Functionality

**How It Works:**

1. **From Calendar:**
   - Tap any day with a fast (🔥 or ❌)
   - Opens "Edit Fast" view
   - Scroll down → See red "Delete Fast" button
   - Tap Delete → Confirmation alert appears
   - Confirm → Fast permanently deleted

2. **From Recent Fasts List:**
   - Tap any fast in the list
   - Opens same "Edit Fast" view
   - Red "Delete Fast" button at bottom
   - Tap Delete → Confirmation alert appears
   - Confirm → Fast permanently deleted

**Confirmation Alert:**
```
Delete Fast
Are you sure you want to delete this fast?
This action cannot be undone.

[Cancel] [Delete]
```

**What Happens When You Delete:**
- ✅ Fast removed from history
- ✅ Calendar updated (flame/X disappears)
- ✅ Recent Fasts list updated
- ✅ Streaks recalculated automatically
- ✅ All statistics updated (Lifetime Days, Hours, etc.)
- ✅ Changes saved immediately

**Safety Features:**
- Red button color indicates destructive action (Apple HIG)
- Confirmation alert prevents accidental deletion
- Clear warning: "This action cannot be undone"
- Only shows when editing existing fast (not when adding new)

---

#### 📅 Intelligent Month View Default

**Problem Solved:**
- **Before:** On Oct 1, Month view showed "October 2025" with "No data available" even though latest fast was Sep 30
- **After:** Month view intelligently shows "September 2025" (where the data is)

**How It Works:**

1. User opens History → Taps "Month" view
2. App checks: Does current month have any fasting data?
3. **If YES:** Show current month (normal behavior)
4. **If NO:** Find most recent month with data and show that month
5. User can still navigate forward/backward with arrow buttons

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Current Month Has Data**
- Date: Oct 15, 2025
- Last fast: Oct 10, 2025
- **Result:** Shows "October 2025" ✅

**Scenario 2: Current Month Empty**
- Date: Oct 1, 2025
- Last fast: Sep 30, 2025
- **Result:** Shows "September 2025" (where data is) ✅

**Scenario 3: Multiple Months Gap**
- Date: Dec 1, 2025
- Last fast: Sep 15, 2025
- **Result:** Shows "September 2025" (jumps back 3 months) ✅

**Technical Details:**
- Only initializes once when switching to Month view
- Doesn't interfere with manual navigation (arrows still work)
- Respects 12-month history limit (won't go back more than 11 months)
- Uses Calendar API for accurate month calculations

---

### Files Modified

#### 1. **FastingManager.swift**
**New Method Added:**
```swift
func deleteFast(for date: Date) {
    let calendar = Calendar.current
    let targetDay = calendar.startOfDay(for: date)

    // Remove the fast for this day
    fastingHistory.removeAll { session in
        calendar.startOfDay(for: session.startTime) == targetDay
    }

    // Recalculate streaks from history
    calculateStreakFromHistory()

    saveHistory()
}
```

**Why This Design:**
- Uses date-based deletion (deletes fast for entire day)
- Automatically recalculates streaks (important for data integrity)
- Saves to UserDefaults immediately
- Follows existing pattern of other FastingManager methods

#### 2. **HistoryView.swift**

**A. AddEditFastView - Delete Button:**
- Added `@State private var showingDeleteAlert` for alert state
- Added red "Delete Fast" button (only shows if editing existing fast)
- Added `.alert` modifier with confirmation
- Added `deleteFast()` helper function

**B. Recent Fasts List - Tap Gesture:**
- Removed broken swipe actions (didn't work in VStack)
- Added `.contentShape(Rectangle())` for full-width tapping
- Added `.onTapGesture` to open Edit Fast view

**C. FastingGraphView - Intelligent Month View:**
- Added `initializeMonthView()` function
- Calls initialization when user switches to Month view
- Checks current month for data
- Finds most recent month with data if current is empty
- Sets `selectedMonthOffset` to show correct month

---

### User Benefits

---

### API Changes

**New Public Method:**
```swift
// FastingManager.swift
func deleteFast(for date: Date)
```

**Parameters:**
- `date: Date` - The date of the fast to delete (uses start date)

**Behavior:**

---

### Design Decisions

#### Why Delete by Date (Not by ID)?
- Existing pattern: One fast per day
- Matches calendar selection behavior
- Simpler user mental model
- Consistent with addManualFast logic

#### Why Confirmation Alert?
- Follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- Prevents accidental data loss
- Standard iOS pattern (Mail, Photos, etc.)
- "Cancel" is safe default (left position)

#### Why Tap Instead of Swipe?
- Swipe actions require List view (not VStack)
- Would require refactoring working UI
- Tap is more discoverable
- Consistent with calendar tap behavior
- Simpler implementation

#### Why Intelligent Month View?
- Better first-time user experience
- Reduces confusion ("Where's my data?")
- Follows principle of least surprise
- Common pattern in analytics apps

---

### Known Limitations

- Delete is permanent (no undo function)
- Can only delete one fast at a time
- Month view limited to 12 months back
- Delete doesn't sync to HealthKit (if implemented later)

---

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Batch delete (select multiple fasts)
- [ ] Undo delete (with timeout)
- [ ] Delete confirmation preference (disable alert)
- [ ] Export before delete (data backup)
- [ ] Soft delete with trash bin
- [ ] Year/All view intelligent defaults

---

## Previous Features



## 1. Current Month Calendar View 📅

### What Changed:
- **Before:** Calendar showed last 28 days (4 weeks rolling)
- **After:** Calendar shows the **current month** (e.g., "January 2025")

### Features:
- ✅ Displays full current month (28-31 days depending on month)
- ✅ Proper alignment - empty cells for days before month starts
- ✅ Shows month and year in header (e.g., "🔥 January 2025")
- ✅ All days of current month visible
- ✅ Auto-updates when month changes

## 2. Edit Fast Times When Stopping ⏰

### What Changed:
When you tap "Stop Fast" and confirm, you now get **3 options**:
1. **Cancel** - Keep fasting
2. **Edit Times** - Adjust start/end times before stopping
3. **Stop** - End fast with current times

### Edit Times Screen:
Shows a form with:
- **Start Time Picker** - Adjust when you actually started
- **End Time Picker** - Adjust when you actually ended
- **Duration Display** - Shows calculated duration (e.g., "20h 15m")
- **Save & Stop Fast** button (red)

### Use Cases:

**Scenario 1: Forgot to Start Timer**
- You started fasting at 6:00 PM yesterday
- Forgot to tap "Start Fast" until 7:00 PM
- Stop fast → Edit Times → Set start to 6:00 PM ✅

**Scenario 2: Adjust End Time**
- You broke your fast at 2:00 PM
- Didn't stop timer until 3:00 PM
- Stop fast → Edit Times → Set end to 2:00 PM ✅

**Scenario 3: Backdating Fasts**
- You fasted yesterday but forgot to track it
- Start fast → Stop fast → Edit Times

   - **Stop** → Ends fast immediately with current times

4. **In Time Editor (if you chose Edit):**
   - Adjust start date/time

   - See live duration calculation
   - Tap "Save & Stop Fast" to finalize
   - Or tap "Cancel" to go back

### Technical Details:

**Time Pickers:**
