# Weight Tracking Fixes - Multiple Entries Per Day

## Date: October 1, 2025

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Manual entries not appearing in Weight History
**Root Cause:** WeightManager was limiting to one entry per day, replacing existing entries instead of adding new ones.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed the one-per-day check in `WeightManager.swift` (lines 19-32)
- Now allows multiple weight entries per day
- Each entry is stored with its unique timestamp

**Changed Code:**
```swift
// BEFORE:
func addWeightEntry(_ entry: WeightEntry) {
    let calendar = Calendar.current
    let entryDay = calendar.startOfDay(for: entry.date)

    // Check if there's already an entry for this day
    if let existingIndex = weightEntries.firstIndex(where: {
        calendar.startOfDay(for: $0.date) == entryDay
    }) {
        // Replace existing entry for this day
        weightEntries[existingIndex] = entry
    } else {
        // Add new entry
        weightEntries.append(entry)
    }

    // Sort by date (most recent first)
    weightEntries.sort { $0.date > $1.date }
}

// AFTER:
func addWeightEntry(_ entry: WeightEntry) {
    // Simply add the entry - allow multiple entries per day
    weightEntries.append(entry)

    // Sort by date (most recent first)
    weightEntries.sort { $0.date > $1.date }
}
```

**Reasoning:**
- Users may want to track multiple weigh-ins per day (morning, evening, post-workout, etc.)
- Removing the limit allows full flexibility without data loss
- Sorting by date ensures most recent entries appear first

---

### 2. ✅ Added Time Picker to Manual Entry

**Enhancement:** Users can now select both date AND time when adding manual weight entries.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated DatePicker in `AddWeightView.swift` (line 18)
- Changed from date-only to date + time picker

**Changed Code:**
```swift
// BEFORE:
DatePicker("Date", selection: $selectedDate, displayedComponents: [.date])

// AFTER:
DatePicker("Date & Time", selection: $selectedDate, displayedComponents: [.date, .hourAndMinute])
```

**Reasoning:**
- Allows users to accurately record when they weighed themselves
- Important for multiple daily entries to distinguish between morning/evening weigh-ins
- Aligns with HealthKit data which includes timestamps

---

### 3. ✅ Added Swipe-to-Delete Functionality

**Enhancement:** Users can now swipe left on any weight entry to delete it.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `.swipeActions()` modifier to WeightHistoryRow in `WeightTrackingView.swift`
- Changed WeightHistoryListView to use `@ObservedObject` for reactive updates
- Set `allowsFullSwipe: true` for quick deletion

**Changed Code:**
```swift
// In WeightHistoryListView
struct WeightHistoryListView: View {
    @ObservedObject var weightManager: WeightManager  // Changed from let

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 12) {
            Text("Weight History")
                .font(.headline)
                .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)

            ForEach(Array(weightManager.weightEntries.prefix(10))) { entry in
                WeightHistoryRow(entry: entry, weightManager: weightManager)
                    .swipeActions(edge: .trailing, allowsFullSwipe: true) {
                        Button(role: .destructive) {
                            weightManager.deleteWeightEntry(entry)
                        } label: {
                            Label("Delete", systemImage: "trash")
                        }
                    }
                Divider()
            }
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

**Reasoning:**
- Swipe-to-delete is the iOS standard for list deletion
- Provides quick access to delete without long-press menu
- `allowsFullSwipe: true` allows full swipe to delete immediately
- Kept existing context menu (long-press) for redundancy

### 4. ✅ Added Time Display to Weight History

**Enhancement:** Weight history now shows both date AND time for each entry.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated WeightHistoryRow in `WeightTrackingView.swift` (lines 422-430)
- Added time display next to date with bullet separator

**Changed Code:**
```swift
// BEFORE:
Text(entry.date, style: .date)
    .font(.headline)

// AFTER:
HStack(spacing: 4) {
    Text(entry.date, style: .date)
        .font(.headline)
    Text("•")
        .foregroundColor(.secondary)
    Text(entry.date, style: .time)
        .font(.subheadline)
        .foregroundColor(.secondary)
}
```

**Display Format:**
- Example: "July 30, 2025 • 9:15 AM"
- Date in bold, time in secondary color
- Bullet separator for visual clarity

**Reasoning:**
- Users need to see the time to distinguish multiple daily entries
- Matches the time picker in manual entry form
- Consistent with iOS Health app's time display

## Testing Instructions:

### Test Multiple Entries Per Day:
1. Open Weight Tracking
2. Tap "+" to add manual entry
3. Select today's date at 8:00 AM
4. Enter weight (e.g., 175.0)
5. Save
6. Tap "+" again
7. Select today's date at 6:00 PM
8. Enter different weight (e.g., 176.5)
9. Save
10. ✅ Both entries should appear in history with times

### Test Swipe-to-Delete:
1. Go to Weight History
2. Swipe left on any entry
3. Red delete button should appear
4. Tap "Delete" or complete full swipe
5. ✅ Entry should be removed immediately

### Test Time Display:
1. View Weight History
2. ✅ Each entry should show: "Date • Time"
3. ✅ Example: "Oct 1, 2025 • 9:31 AM"

## User Benefits:

✅ **Flexibility:** Track multiple weigh-ins per day (morning, evening, post-workout)
✅ **Accuracy:** Record exact time of measurement
✅ **Convenience:** Quick swipe-to-delete for mistakes
✅ **Clarity:** See exactly when each measurement was taken

---

## Breaking Changes:

⚠️ **None** - Changes are backwards compatible

**Data Migration:**
- Existing entries keep their timestamps
- No data loss or corruption
- Entries continue to sort by date/time (most recent first)

---

## Known Limitations:

1. **History Display:** Only shows 10 most recent entries
   - Future: Add "Show All" or pagination

2. **Chart Visualization:** Multiple daily entries may clutter the chart
   - Current: Chart automatically handles this (averages per day)
   - Future: Consider daily average or latest entry per day for chart

3. **HealthKit Sync:** HealthKit may merge multiple same-day entries
   - iOS behavior, not app issue
   - Manual entries are preserved locally

---

## Next Steps (If Issues Found):

### If manual entries still not appearing:
1. Check `WeightManager.saveWeightEntries()` is being called
2. Verify UserDefaults persistence
3. Check console logs for errors

### If swipe-to-delete not working:
1. Ensure running iOS 15+
2. Try building clean (Cmd + Shift + K)
3. Restart Xcode

### If time picker not showing:
1. Verify `displayedComponents: [.date, .hourAndMinute]`
2. Check iOS version supports time picker style

## Technical Notes:

### Why Allow Multiple Daily Entries?

**User Research:**
- Morning weigh-ins are most accurate (before eating/drinking)
- Evening weigh-ins track daily fluctuation
- Post-workout weigh-ins measure water loss
- Medical conditions may require multiple daily measurements

**Industry Standard:**
- Apple Health allows multiple daily entries
- Renpho allows multiple daily entries
- Withings allows multiple daily entries
- We should match user expectations

### Performance Considerations:

**Current Implementation:**
- All entries stored in memory via `@Published var weightEntries`
- SwiftUI automatically updates UI when array changes
- O(n log n) sorting on each add (acceptable for <1000 entries)

**Future Optimization (if needed):**
- Lazy loading for >100 entries
- Pagination in history view
- Database storage (SQLite/CoreData) for >500 entries

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing

**Build Required:** Yes - User needs to rebuild in Xcode

**Expected Build Time:** 20-30 seconds
