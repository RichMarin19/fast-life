# Fast lIFe - Recent Updates

## New Features Added ✨

### 1. Stop Confirmation Dialog 🛑
**What it does:** When you tap "Stop Fast", you now get a confirmation alert.

**How it works:**
- Tap "Stop Fast" (red button)
- Alert appears: "Stop Fast? Are you sure you want to end your fast?"
- **Cancel** - Returns to timer (fast continues)
- **Stop** - Ends the fast and saves to history

**Why:** Prevents accidentally ending your fast with a misclick.

---

### 2. Streak Tracking 🔥
**What it does:** Tracks consecutive days where you reached your fasting goal.

**How it works:**
- Complete a fast that meets your goal → Streak starts at 1
- Complete another goal-met fast the next day → Streak increases to 2
- Keep going daily → Streak keeps growing
- Miss a goal or skip a day → Streak resets to 0
- Incomplete fast (stopped early) → Streak resets to 0

**Streak Logic:**
- Only counts fasts where you **reached your goal** (e.g., 20 hours if that's your goal)
- Must be done on consecutive days (checked by calendar date)
- If you fast yesterday and today, streak continues
- If you skip a day, streak breaks

**Display:**
- Shows on main timer screen when streak > 0
- Orange flame icon 🔥 with text: "X days streak"
- Hidden when streak = 0
- Persists across app launches

## How to Use

### Testing Stop Confirmation
1. Start a fast
2. Tap "Stop Fast" button
3. You'll see the alert
4. Choose "Cancel" or "Stop"

### Building a Streak
**Day 1:**
- Set goal to 20h
- Start fast
- Wait 20+ hours
- Stop fast → Streak = 1 day ✅

**Day 2:**
- Start another fast
- Wait 20+ hours
- Stop fast → Streak = 2 days ✅

**Day 3:**
- Start fast but stop at 15h → Streak = 0 ❌ (didn't meet goal)

**Starting Over:**
- Set goal to 20h
- Complete 20h fast → Streak = 1 day (starts fresh)

---

## Technical Details

### Streak Calculation
```swift
// Streak continues if:
- Current fast met the goal (duration >= goal hours)
- Last goal-met fast was yesterday or today (consecutive days)

// Streak breaks if:
- Current fast is incomplete (stopped before goal)
- More than 1 day gap since last goal-met fast
```

### Data Persistence
- **currentStreak** saved to UserDefaults
- Loads automatically on app launch
- Updates when you stop a fast

### UI Changes
- **ContentView.swift**: Added confirmation alert + streak display
- **FastingManager.swift**: Added streak tracking logic
- No changes to existing timer, history, or goal features

---

## Examples

### Scenario 1: Perfect Week
- Mon: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 1
- Tue: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 2
- Wed: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 3
- Thu: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 4
- Fri: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 5
- Sat: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 6
- Sun: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 7 🔥

### Scenario 2: Broken Streak
- Mon: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 1
- Tue: 15h fast ❌ (stopped early) → Streak = 0
- Wed: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 1 (starts over)

### Scenario 3: Skipped Day
- Mon: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 1
- Tue: No fast → Streak = 1 (still 1)
- Wed: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 0 (gap broke streak)
- Thu: 20h fast ✅ → Streak = 1 (starts fresh)

---

## What Didn't Change ✅

All existing features still work exactly the same:
- ✅ Dual timer display (elapsed + countdown)
- ✅ Customizable goals (8-48 hours)
- ✅ Progress ring animation
- ✅ History tracking (last 10 fasts)
- ✅ Notifications when goal reached
- ✅ Settings persistence
- ✅ Tab navigation
