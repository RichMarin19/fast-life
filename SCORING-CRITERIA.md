## üìã EVALUATION PHILOSOPHY

### Who Scores (And Who Doesn't)

**‚úÖ EVALUATORS:**
1. **AI Expert (Claude)** - Senior iOS Developer perspective, technical analysis
2. **External Consultant** - Independent expert validation, fresh perspective
3. **Industry Standards** - Apple, Google, Meta benchmarks and best practices

**‚ùå NOT AN EVALUATOR:**
- **Product Owner/Visionary** - Sets direction, reviews scores, but doesn't score
- **Why:** Potential bias on own vision, separation of concerns (vision vs execution)

### Evaluation Principles

**Objectivity Requirements:**
- Evidence-based scoring (cite specific examples)
- Triangulation (compare multiple evaluator perspectives)
- Industry benchmarks (compare to Apple/Google/Meta standards)
- Repeatable criteria (consistent scoring across evaluators)

**Conflict Resolution:**
- When expert scores diverge, cite Industry Standards as tiebreaker
- Document reasoning for all scores
- Seek consensus through discussion of evidence
